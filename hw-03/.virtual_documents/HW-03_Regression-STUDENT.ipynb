#Differences in Features:
    # Both appear to have strong correlation between Free and total Sulfur Dioxide
    #Biggest difference is correlations for density.
    #Red wine has very strong postiive correlation between denisty and citric acid and citric acid and fixed acidity
    #White wine has strong negative correlation between alcohol and density and strong positive correlation between
    #residual sugar and density.
    #Annot = True used to determine this, but looks ugly so not included in final heatmaps.
